## Disclaimers:

**THIS IS A FORK OF THE [COMFY](https://github.com/NYRI4/Comfy-theme) AND [DISCORD-202K](https://github.com/Tamago-iku/Discord-202K-theme).** Major assets have been removed from Comfy down to literally only keeping some of it's color pallete. Added on top of it is Discord-202K's CSS file, which has also been tweaked a bit. The rest is just additions to fully realize LeoCharte's concept art. _PLEASE SUPPORT THE ORIGINAL THEME DEVS AND PAY THEIR GITHUB A VISIT!_
